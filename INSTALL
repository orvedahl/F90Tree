To install this package:

	1) set the F90TreeDir environment variable

	2) from within the F90TreeDir directory, execute the install script

For python 2 support:
	export F90TreeDir=/path/to/F90Tree/

	cd $F90TreeDir

	bin/install.sh 2

For python 3 support
	export F90TreeDir=/path/to/F90Tree/

	cd $F90TreeDir

	bin/install.sh 3

Odd situations:

	use a specific python executable for version 2.7:
		bin/install 2 python2.7

	use a specific python executable for version 3.6:
		bin/install 3 python3.6

	the "python" command actually points to a python 3 installation:
		bin/install 3 python
