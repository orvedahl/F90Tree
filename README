Python utilities to parse Fortran source code to determine the calling tree.

Suppose there is a Fortran program with the following:

    program main
        ...
        call sub1(...)
        call sub2(...)

        contains
            subroutine sub1(...)
                call subroutine sub4()
            end subroutine sub1

            subroutine sub2(...)
                call subroutine sub3()
            end subroutine sub2

            subroutine sub3(...)
                call subroutine sub5()
            end subroutine sub3

            subroutine sub4(...)
                call subroutine sub5()
            end subroutine sub4

            subroutine sub5(...)
                ...
            end subroutine sub5
    end program main

Then running this utility should produce the following tree

    main
        |-sub1
            |-sub4
                |-sub5
        |-sub2
            |-sub3
                |-sub5

The various subroutines can be spread across different files
and/or stored in modules.
